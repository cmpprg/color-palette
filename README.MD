# color-palette

## purpose:
  As hard as I looked, I could not find a good / simple tool to visualize colors side by side. I was developing my profile site and it was necessary to come up with a color scheme. I wanted something simple and was hoping eventually to make it a chrome extension though I never got that far yet. I used it as a lesson in DOM manipulation and tried to use the least amount of HTML that I could. I wanted to learn to generate all I needed through DOM.
  
  Shrink the screen if you want vertical layered presentation, I was planning on making a toggle in the upper right for this. I don't have time right now.
  
## Instructions:

- Choose how many color swatches you want to work with 2-6
- There is a dark mode and a light mode button that you can click based on what you want
- input hex colors to change the color on each swatch
- Enjoy! I hope it helps!

## my hopes:
  I hope someone will take this project, love it, and continue working on it. There are plenty of bugs to work out and I'm sure a couple of design flaws in there.
